            <p>
              Winners are determined based on the total return percentage of their portfolio at the end of the competition period. The returns are calculated using real market data. The higher your return percentage, the higher your ranking on the leaderboard.

              In most competitions, once you submit your portfolio, it cannot be modified for the duration of the competition. However, some special competitions may allow portfolio rebalancing at specified intervals. The competition details will clearly state whether modifications are allowed.
